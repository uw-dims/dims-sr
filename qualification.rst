Qualification provisions
========================

.. todo::

    This section shall define a set of qualification methods and shall specify
    for each requirement in Section :ref:`requirements` the method(s) to be
    used to ensure that the requirement has been met. A table may be used to
    present this information, or each requirement in Section
    :ref:`requirements` may be annotated with the method(s) to be used.
    Qualification methods may include:

    #. Demonstration: The operation of the CSCI, or a part of the CSCI,
       that relies on observable functional operation not requiring the use
       of instrumentation, special test equipment, or subsequent analysis.
    #. Test: The operation of the CSCI, or a part of the CSCI, using
       instrumentation or other special test equipment to collect data for
       later analysis.
    #. Analysis: The processing of accumulated data obtained from other
       qualification methods. Examples are reduction, interpretation, or
       extrapolation of test results.
    #. Inspection: The visual examination of CSCI code, documentation,
       etc.
    #. Special qualification methods: Any special qualification methods
       for the CSCI, such as special tools, techniques, procedures,
       facilities, and acceptance limits.
