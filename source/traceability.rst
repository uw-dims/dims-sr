Requirements traceability
=========================

.. todo::

    This paragraph shall contain:

    #. Traceability from each CSCI requirement in this specification to
       the system (or subsystem, if applicable) requirements it addresses.
       (Alternatively, this traceability may be provided by annotating each
       requirement in Section :ref:`requirements`.)

       .. note::

           Each level of system refinement may result in requirements not directly
           traceable to higher-level requirements. For example, a system
           architectural design that creates multiple CSCIs may result in
           requirements about how the CSCIs will interface, even though these
           interfaces are not covered in system requirements. Such requirements may
           be traced to a general requirement such as "system implementation" or to
           the system design decisions that resulted in their generation.

    #. Traceability from each system (or subsystem, if applicable)
       requirement allocated to this CSCI to the CSCI requirements that
       address it. All system (subsystem) requirements allocated to this CSCI
       shall be accounted for. Those that trace to CSCI requirements
       contained in IRSs shall reference those IRSs.
